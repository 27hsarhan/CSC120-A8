- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
    My class is a character, like in a video game. It has an inventory and such.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
    No new methods. But I will probably add an inventory thing tomorrow.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    The advice is to start earlier. Lots of things are not working but I will figure them outin the morning.
